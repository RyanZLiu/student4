# Code and Usage of Blog
- Throughtout the entirety of the trimester, I’ve used my student blog to organize and work on computer science work, this blog has helped me hone my skills in organizing stuff into a time box which helps for the easy access of previous material which helps to study for tests and exam. This time box is sort of a book which helped organize my thoughts as well as my works. I have been updating my timebox with every individual lesson, including my homework, which helps me a lot as I can quickly go back to each lesson and refer to the notes and code to help me when I am having difficulties coding in Python.

- I’ve updated the timebox every week for the plans I plan to accomplish during each week. This acts as something that I can refer back to for future reference and also results in a pretty, well organized journal.

Pseudocode is like a recipe for writing computer programs, but instead of using the exact rules of a programming language, it uses plain English or a mix of English and simple programming terms. It helps programmers plan out how to solve a problem or create a program without getting bogged down in the specific details of a programming language. It's like sketching out a plan before building something, giving a clear idea of the steps to follow. This makes it easier for beginners to understand and design their programs before diving into actual coding. Overall, pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm should do.

# Tri 1 Reflection
I thoroughly enjoyed this class, especially exploring various coding techniques, learning innovative ways to organize information, and discovering multiple approaches to problem-solving and creative development. The trimester flew by so quickly that documenting it proved to be a challenge. One significant achievement was successfully implementing the "make" function and establishing a local host site that I could then deploy on GitHub. Another highlight was the student lessons, allowing me to learn the Python fundamentals from peers like me. Before this class, I mainly coded in Java, so learning the Python syntax was new to me. The student lessons heavily helped this. The Web Development Basics project, fostering teamwork, was a positive experience, as was the final project for Night at the Museum, where I delved into API integration and data extraction/display. Overall, the trimester provided opportunities to learn about the fascinating world of coding, adopt new methodologies, form connections with peers, and collaborate in a team setting.

Looking ahead to trimester two, my goals include meeting new people, acquiring additional coding skills, refining my coding proficiency, delving deeper into API work, and enhancing integration techniques. I aim to learn how to collaborate effectively in new teams, explore innovative coding and agile methodologies, and ensure another rewarding trimester in AP CSP. If I'm up for a challenge, I'm thinking about exploring the backend to see firsthand what it's like and understand the differences between the frontend and backend. I know writing backend code will be tricky for me, since I am a beginner python coder, but from this experience I am sure that I will improve immensely.
