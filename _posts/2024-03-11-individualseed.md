# Reflection

Overall, the Night at the Museum event proved to be a highly enjoyable experience. Our presentation ran smoothly from 6:30 to 7:00, receiving a plethora of positive reactions for our project. The focal point of our project revolved around a tool allowing users to craft their own memes by directly uploading images from their personal files and adding custom top and bottom text. Following meme creation, users could opt to share them and contribute to a growing database of memes uploaded by others. Navigating through this database, users could freely download any memes they found amusing. Many participants relished the opportunity to create their own memes and explore the creations of others. Additionally, some viewers found particular enjoyment in our detailed explanation and demonstration of the intricate code powering our project. We thoroughly enjoyed elucidating our project to others and facilitating their hands-on experience with it. Furthermore, we received valuable feedback, which we aim to integrate as we further develop our project.

# Feedback/Areas to improve

A prevalent suggestion from users who utilized our site was to enlarge both the images and text featured on the memes. Doing so would enhance visibility and ease the meme creation process. Additionally, simplifying and refining the site navigation, particularly the top bar, was noted as an area for improvement. Some users expressed interest in having more customization options to tailor their memes, thus adding a personal touch. As we work on refining our project during the break for the final review and College Board test, we will certainly prioritize incorporating this feedback. Our primary focus will be on enhancing the user experience, as it plays a vital role in our project, given that everything revolves around catering to user preferences.

# Something in CompSci that impressed 
Among the myriad of impressive projects, one that stood out to me was a Clash Royale-themed website showcased at 6:00. This project intrigued me as it offered the ability to create personalized Clash Royale decks and participate in quizzes to receive a deck tailored to your preferences. The website boasted numerous features and an intuitive user interface, making it highly accessible. Moreover, the efficiency of the code they employed was notable, providing me with valuable insights as I examined it.



# Something outside of CompSci that impressed.
Outside of the realm of Computer Science, I encountered some captivating photography. One particular image that caught my eye depicted a child riding a bike across a bed of woodchips. This picture served as a homage to a renowned photograph by a celebrated photographer. The composition of the photo was meticulously arranged, with excellent lighting and positioning of elements contributing to its overall appeal.
