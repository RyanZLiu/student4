## Week 1

## Day 1 
I worked on getting my GitHub page online. I had a problem with my GitHub site where the md file wasn't synced up correctly to vscode, which led to my code changes to not update. At first I tried changing the website name, but that didn't work. I eventually fixed it by creating a new github repository and this time syncing up and configuring it correct to vscode. 

## Day 2
I worked on editing and customizing my home page. I included an introduction about me in the home page and added my freeform about me drawing. I changed my them from midnight to hacker.

## Day 3
I mainly just made some minor changes in preparation for the tech check. One of them being about the Linux Shell.

## Day 4
I added a calculator to my blog and also figured out how to add videos. I included a youtube video of my favorite tennis match on my home page as well as helped others with their problems.

## Day 5
I started working on my Python quiz, but wasn't really able to getting it fully up and running. The code was written, but there were just some minor issues that led to undesirable results.
