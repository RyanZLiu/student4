    "First I changed the data inside the for loop, as to obtain all of the letters, the for loop needs to iterate as many times as there is letters. alphabet.length essentially just gives how many characters are in the variable alphabet. The for loop will iterate as long as i < alphabet.length. I also changed the i in the push command to alphabet[i] as i itself is simply a placeholder for each character of the variable alphabet. To print each value stored in the variable, we need to push each character, alphabet[i], into the alphabetList array. In the end, you'll see an array containing all the letters of the alphabet printed in the console when you run this code."

    "The main issue in the original code was the incorrect loop condition (i < alphabetList) and the inaccurate console output message. I changed the loop condition to (i < alphabetList.length) to iterate through all the elements of the array. The condition inside the if statement was incorrect because an array starts at 0, meaning that when i=5, the code will technically print the i+1 = 6th letter. To fix this I changed the condition to i+1 so that the if statement is satisfied when the 4th placement of the array or the 5th element of the array is reached. The console.log statement was also incorrect as it should first print the letter, alphabetList[i], and then later on the placement of the letter, letterNumber."
